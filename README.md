### GEdge-Platform

GEdge-Platform is a cloud edge computing platform for 5G network and AI

It supports ultra low-latency service experiences rapidly by processing data at the edge of the network without delays in processing and transmission to central cloud.





data is processed at a location close to the terminal, and response speed sensitive service** is supported based on distributed collaboration* between central cloud-edge-terminals. Intelligent cloud edge SW platform

5G and AI. By virtualization it can shield heterogeneous characteristics and gives a unified access of cloud edge, mobile edge and private edge. For AI it provides low-latency, high-reliability and cost-optimal computing support at the edge through the cluster management and intelligent scheduling of multi-tier clusters. And at the same time OTE-Stack makes device-edge-cloud collaborative computing possible.

Note: OTE-Stack is a heavy work in progress.

The ability to locate performance-sensitive applications and network functions very close to the subscribers is critical to success as operators seek to offer massive broadband and ultra-low latency services. Edge cloud solution delivers ultra-responsive service experiences by rapidly processing content at the edge of the network.

Cloud computing is transforming the telecoms landscape, offering flexibility that is need to enabling modern, agile business opportunities with secured and high availability services. Centralized network architecture alone does not cost-effectively support the ultra-low latency and extreme throughput demanded by the service like Internet of Things, cloud gaming and 5G.
